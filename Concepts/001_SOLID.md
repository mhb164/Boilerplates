# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsibility
* Each module or class should have only one responsibility.
* Each software module or class should have only one reason to change. 

## Open-Closed 
Software entities, such as modules, classes, functions should be 
* open for extension 
* closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution 
* Child class objects should be able to replace parent class objects.

## Interface Segregation 
* Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use. 

## Dependency Inversion 
* High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions. 
* Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
